To set up SSH login from your local machine to a remote machine and enable logging to show the full process, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

2. Generate an SSH key pair by typing the following command:

   ```
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```

   This will generate a public and private key pair in the `~/.ssh` directory of your local machine.

3. Copy the public key to the remote machine by typing the following command:

   ```
   ssh-copy-id username@remote_machine
   ```

   Replace `username` with your username on the remote machine, and `remote_machine` with the hostname or IP address of the remote machine you want to connect to. You will be prompted to enter your password.

   This command will copy your public key to the remote machine and append it to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file, which will allow you to log in to the remote machine without a password.

4. Test the SSH login by typing the following command:

   ```
   ssh username@remote_machine
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you should be logged in to the remote machine without being prompted for a password.

5. To enable logging to show the full process, edit the SSH configuration file on the remote machine by typing the following command:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

   Find the line that starts with `LogLevel` and change the value to `VERBOSE`. If the line is commented out, remove the `#` at the beginning of the line.

   Save the file and exit the editor.

6. Restart the SSH service by typing the following command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

   This will apply the changes to the SSH configuration.

7. Test the logging by typing the following command:

   ```
   ssh username@remote_machine "ps -aux"
   ```

   This will log in to the remote machine and execute the `ps -aux` command, which will display the full process list. The output will also be logged in the `/var/log/auth.log` file on the remote machine.

That's it! You have now set up SSH login from your local machine to a remote machine and enabled logging to show the full process.
